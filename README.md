# More threes, more offense?

The three-point revolution. Moreyball. Whatever you may call the high rate of threes being attempted in today's NBA, it is a playstyle that seems like it is here to stay and seemingly for good reason. A team such as the Houston Rockets will probably point to their offensive and overall success in recent years as evidence of the benefits of shooting more threes. Players are told to minimize midrange shots (shots between the paint and the three-point line) and teams like the Rockets almost avoid them completely. But, are these Houston Rockets teams outliers because of their arsenal of shooters, or does shooting more threes actually improve a team's offense?

To answer this question, I investigated NBA team data from 2007 (when Daryl Morey took over as General Manager of the Rockets) until the most recent NBA season. The metric I decided to include in my assessement was Offensive Rating, since it is widely used as the overall measure of a team's offense. Offensive Rating is the number of points scored by a team per 100 posessions and standardizes the points scored by teams. Thus, my initial hypothesis was that if shooting threes is beneficial for the team, then their should be a correlation between three-pointers attempted and offensive rating. Likewise, if midrange shots are detrimental to a team's offense, then shooting more of them should hurt their overall offense. 

Indeed, graphs that measured these two types of shots against offensive rating showed a distinct negative relationship between a offensive rating and midrange shots attempted while indicating a positive correlation between three-point attempts and offensive performance.

To investigate further, I wanted to see whether the league average offensive rating improved year-on-year along with the increase in threes attempted. Interestingly, there were quite a few years where the NBA's average offensive rating was higher than in years where the league as a whole attempted more threes. Yet, over the past three years when three-point attempts have ballooned, the league's average offensive rating has skyROCKETed (get it?).
