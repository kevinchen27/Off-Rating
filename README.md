# Off-Rating
Investigating relationship between Team Offensive Rating and Midrange Shot Attempts. The aim of this project is to investigate whether midrange shots adversely effect a team's offense measured using Offensive Rating, the consensus metric to define a team's offense. While initial findings seemed to suggest taking less midrange shots to improve offense, further investigations and checking of assumptions and data is required.
